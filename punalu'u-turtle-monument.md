KAUILA AND THE SEA TURTLES OF PUNALU'U

The mystical turtle, Kauila, makes her home in the Kau District at Punalu'u Bay. According to Hawaiian mythology, Kauila was empowered with the ability to turn herself from a turtle into human form and would play with the children along the shoreline and keep watch over them. The people of Kau loved Kauila as the guardian of their children and also for her spring that gave them pure drinking water.

The presence of Kauila can still be felt today by the sea turtles that inhabit this special place. The Hawaiian Honu (Green Sea Turtle) can be regularly seen in the bay feeding on limu growing in the shallows. In addition, the Honu'ea (Hawksbill Turtle) sometimes enters the bay at night to crawl ashore and deposit eggs in the black sand. Both species of sea turtles are fully protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and wildlife laws of the State of Hawaii. Enjoy watching these marvelous creatures but do not touch or disturb them in any way.
